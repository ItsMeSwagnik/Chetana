# Changes Made

## Admin Functionality Improvements

### 1. Fixed View Reports Button
- Added proper error handling and logging to `loadReports()` function
- Enhanced `displayReports()` function with better styling and error handling
- Added CSS styles for reports section in `styles.css`
- Reports now display properly when admin clicks "View Reports" button

### 2. Allow Admins to Delete Welcome Posts
- Updated forum-client.js to allow admins to delete any post, including welcome posts
- Modified the `canDelete` logic to remove welcome post protection for admins
- Admins can now delete welcome posts and comments on welcome posts
- Regular users still cannot delete welcome posts (only their own content)

### Changes Made:
1. **script.js**: Enhanced admin reports functionality with better error handling
2. **forum-client.js**: Removed welcome post deletion restrictions for admins
3. **styles.css**: Added CSS styles for reports section display

### Testing:
1. Login as admin (admin@chetana.com / admin123)
2. Click "View Reports" button - should now show reports properly
3. Go to forum and try to delete welcome posts - should now work for admins
4. Regular users should still be unable to delete welcome posts

All changes maintain security - only admins can delete welcome posts, regular users are still restricted.
