# Language Support Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AI Therapist Response Translation
- **Problem**: AI therapist dummy responses were only available in Hindi, causing other languages to show English responses
- **Solution**: Added AI response translations for all supported languages (Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada)

### 2. Voice-to-Text Language Support
- **Problem**: Voice-to-text was not properly switching languages when user changed language settings
- **Solution**: Enhanced language change handler to update voice chat language and synchronize all language selectors
