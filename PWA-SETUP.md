# चेtanā Progressive Web App (PWA) Setup Guide

## Overview
चेtanā has been converted into a Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides:
- **Offline functionality** - Works without internet connection
- **App-like experience** - Can be installed on devices
- **Push notifications** - Daily reminders and check-ins
- **Background sync** - Data syncs when connection returns
- **Fast loading** - Cached resources for quick startup

## Files Added

### Core PWA Files
1. **`manifest.json`** - Web app manifest defining app metadata
2. **`sw.js`** - Service worker for caching and offline functionality
3. **`pwa.js`** - PWA manager class handling installation and features
4. **`pwa-integration.js`** - Integration with existing app functionality
5. **`pwa-styles.css`** - PWA-specific styling
6. **`offline.html`** - Offline fallback page

### Supporting Files
- **`icons/`** directory for PWA icons (needs actual icon files)
- **`PWA-SETUP.md`** - This setup guide

## Installation Requirements

### 1. Icons Setup
Create the following icon files in the `icons/` directory:
- `icon-72x72.png`
- `icon-96x96.png`
- `icon-128x128.png`
- `icon-144x144.png`
- `icon-152x152.png`
- `icon-192x192.png`
- `icon-384x384.png`
- `icon-512x512.png`

### 2. HTTPS Requirement
PWAs require HTTPS to work properly. For development:
- Use `localhost` (works with HTTP)
- For production, ensure SSL certificate is installed

### 3. Server Configuration
Ensure your server serves the manifest with correct MIME type:
```
Content-Type: application/manifest+json
```

## Features Implemented

### ✅ App Installation
- Install prompt appears on supported browsers
- Custom install button in header
- iOS Safari support with meta tags

### ✅ Offline Functionality
- Assessment data stored offline
- Mood tracking works offline
- Chat history cached
- Automatic sync when online

### ✅ Caching Strategy
- Static files cached immediately
- Dynamic content cached on first visit
- Offline fallback page for uncached routes

### ✅ Background Sync
- Assessment responses sync when online
- Mood data syncs automatically
- Failed requests retried in background

### ✅ Push Notifications
- Daily reminder notifications
- Assessment completion notifications
- Motivation messages
- Crisis support alerts

### ✅ App Shortcuts
- Quick access to AI chat
- Direct link to assessments
- Defined in manifest.json

## Testing the PWA

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
# Serve the app locally (HTTPS recommended)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

### 2. Chrome DevTools
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Check "Manifest" section
4. Test "Service Workers"
5. Simulate offline in "Network" tab

### 3. Lighthouse Audit
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App"
4. Run audit

## Browser Support

### ✅ Fully Supported
- Chrome/Chromium (Android & Desktop)
- Edge (Windows & Android)
- Samsung Internet
- Firefox (limited install support)

### ⚠️ Partial Support
- Safari (iOS/macOS) - No install prompt, but works as PWA
- Firefox - Service worker works, limited install

### ❌ Not Supported
- Internet Explorer
- Older browser versions

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Production
- [ ] Replace placeholder icons with actual चेtanā branding
- [ ] Configure VAPID keys for push notifications
- [ ] Set up HTTPS certificate
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and browsers
- [ ] Verify offline functionality
- [ ] Test install flow

### Server Requirements
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Correct MIME types configured
- [ ] Service worker served with proper headers
- [ ] Manifest.json accessible

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add app screenshots to manifest
- [ ] Configure custom splash screen
- [ ] Set up analytics for PWA usage
- [ ] Add more app shortcuts
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Install prompt not showing:**
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled
- Check manifest.json is valid
- Verify service worker is registered
- Check browser support

**Offline functionality not working:**
- Check service worker registration
- Verify caching strategy
- Test with DevTools offline mode

**Push notifications not working:**
- Configure VAPID keys
- Check notification permissions
- Verify service worker push event handler

### Debug Tools
- Chrome DevTools > Application tab
- Firefox Developer Tools > Application tab
- PWA Builder validation tools
- Lighthouse PWA audit

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets cached with "Cache First"
- API responses cached with "Network First"
- Images cached with "Stale While Revalidate"

### Bundle Optimization
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Optimize images and icons
- Use compression (gzip/brotli)
- Implement code splitting

## Security Considerations

### Service Worker Security
- Serve from same origin
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate cached content
- Implement CSP headers

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive offline data
- Clear cache on logout
- Implement data retention policies
- Follow GDPR/privacy requirements

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Advanced offline sync
- [ ] Background app refresh
- [ ] Biometric authentication
- [ ] Voice command integration
- [ ] AR/VR wellness features

### Integration Opportunities
- [ ] Health app integration (Apple Health, Google Fit)
- [ ] Calendar integration for appointments
- [ ] Social sharing capabilities
- [ ] Wearable device support

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor service worker updates
- Update cached resources
- Review and update manifest
- Test on new browser versions
- Update push notification certificates

### Analytics to Track
- PWA install rates
- Offline usage patterns
- Service worker performance
- Push notification engagement
- User retention metrics
